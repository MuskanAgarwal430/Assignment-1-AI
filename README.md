# 📚 Books to Scrape — E-Commerce Scraper & Static Clone

This project replicates the functionality of a small e-commerce website using AI tools. We scraped real product data from [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com), structured it in CSV/JSON formats, and created a static HTML/CSS mockup that simulates the look of the original website.
